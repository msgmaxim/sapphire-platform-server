Issues:
- entities are used in user
- user callbacks are used in several places (posts, follows, etc)
- move other callbacks out?
- modules/routes don't work without the adn dialect
- need to take all routes and make a module routes...
- validToken helper
- convert to promises (models then controllers)
- more unit tests
